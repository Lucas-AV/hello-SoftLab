# **who are we;**

> ### *English*


**hello;** is a software lab - and a voluntary project - created by Ot√°vio and Ingrid, both undergraduate students at University of Bras√≠lia.


this idea came to our minds after Ot√°vio, software enginnering undergraduate, got extremely unhappy in his major due its lack of real projects which would shape engineers ready to innovate and create a better future. None of the faculties really taught how to code different - or improve - softwares.

as for Ingrid, organizational communications undergraduate, although she cannot code, she is responsible for contacting clients, manage projects and manage comms. (hello you!).


### üëæ why we're here:

+ our **main objective** is to *help software engineering undergraduates think out of the box and understand that software can be applied anywhere for an infinity of purposes*. no, we're not talking all about web here.


+ our voluntary and social values come right after our main objective,
*we do believe we can offer our knowledge to create simple, but very efficient, softwares to small businesses, non-profit organizations and etc.* **in order to solve their problems** (such as accounting, managing, monitoring, modeling...) **in a creative way.**
